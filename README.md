Hi Cellurl here.

I want to control an RC car from far far away.
I am not a terrorist (google me), I work for FedEx but this is a side hobby. Call anytime. 901 213 7824 gpscruise@gmail.com

So I want to modify linphone to replace the headphone Bluetooth with SPP Bluetooth.

The bluetooth-SPP will inject into the linkphone-CHAT messages like "DRIVE FAST", "TURN LEFT".


If someone has already done this, please please point me to it!

There are 400 forks of linphone, I dont know how to find interest in this....

Thanks for reading!
